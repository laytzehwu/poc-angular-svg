# Angular SVG Diagram Prove of Concept

## Just a Prove of Concept

Nowaday, it is not hard to draw digram in HTML5 via SVG. I am seeking a way to draw diagram in HTML5:
- Prgrammatic that readable
- Responce of user behaviour
- Portable that can plug to cloud platform

## Basic of SVG

There are some built in tags allow us to draft shapes and their connections. Please see my [Prototype of Transfer] and enjoy with the [Demo](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/laytzehwu/poc-angular-svg/blob/master/doc/basic-shapes-connections.html).
